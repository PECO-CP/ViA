classdef Graphics
%GRAPHICS Constant class of Graphic properties.
%      GRAPHICS creates a new GRAPHICS class object instance within the parent 
%      class.
%
%      H = GRAPHICS returns the handle to a new GRAPHICS tool, holding data 
%      values relevant to GUI creation.
% 
%      This class was constructed to maintain consistent graphical format
%      across any program additions. Please use the values below for
%      spacing, font size, and figure positioning. Missing graphical values
%      may be edited at the user's discretion; however, to avoid graphical
%      errors, the constants already in this class should never be changed.
