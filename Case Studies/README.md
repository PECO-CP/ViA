**Case Study 3**

Image of *Emiliania huxleyi* viruses (EhV) to explore the quantification of viral abundance (via SYBR Gold staining) and the detection of a fluorescence signal from amino acid tagging. 

This case study includes the following: 
1. EhV Image with SYBR Gold staining (CaseStudy3_FITC.tif)
2. EhV Image with BONCAT (CaseStudy3_Cy3.tif)
3. Guide for the analysis of a single image or both images (CaseStudy3_stepbystep_guide.pdf)
4. Example of the data output if both images are analyzed (CaseStudy3_Data_Labeled Example.xlsx)
